\begin{itemize}
    \item[] specific constraints: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] must use Phalanger front end and its AST data structures,
            \item[] should be ready to be connected in between the Phalanger front end and back end as a middle end,
            \item[] should be ready to be used continuously: interactively re-analyze updated code when used inside IDE,
        \end{itemize}
    \item[] overall description:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] Control Flow graph construction
            \item[] discussion of the choice of intermediate representation (or in fact, why we do not use any intermediate representation).
            \item[] generic framework for Data Flow analyses
            \item[] type analysis
        \end{itemize}
