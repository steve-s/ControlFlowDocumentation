\chapter{Static Analysis}

    More detailed description of what static analysis is 
    (as opposed to for example explicit model checking, 
    verification, etc.). Terminology: context sensitive, 
    path sensitive, symbolic execution, abstract interpretation, etc.
    
    \question{
        Few possibilities here:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item describe algorithms and terminology around static analysis, 
            but this would be all a book work. Then custom modifications and 
            adaptation of those would be described in chapter Implementation.
            \item or describe both here (static analysis in general + custom modifications).
            \item or just reference the literature and describe 
            only custom modifications.
        \end{itemize}
    }

    \section{The PHP Programming Language}
    \question{Or as a standalone chapter?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] What makes static analysis in PHP harder than of statically typed language
        \item[] what are the caveats of PHP we had to deal with:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] arbitrary expressions in continue and break,
                \item[] conditional declarations,
                \item[] user defined auto-loading, ...
            \end{itemize}
        \item[] PHPDoc annotations and their significance for type analysis (especially for the bug hunting)        
    \end{itemize}
