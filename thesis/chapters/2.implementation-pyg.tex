\chapter{Implementation}

    \section{Implementation Specific Constraints}
    
    One of the requirements was that the project should be implemented 
    in the context of Phalanger. 
    
        \begin{itemize}
            \item must use Phalanger front end and its AST data structures,
            \item should be ready to be connected in between the Phalanger front end and back end as a middle end,
            \item should be ready to be used continuously: interactively re-analyze updated code when used inside IDE,
        \end{itemize}    
    
    \section{Overall Design}
    
    \section{Control Flow Graph and Data-flow Analysis}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Control Flow graph construction
            \item discussion of the choice of intermediate representation (or in fact, why we do not use any intermediate representation).
            \item generic framework for Data Flow analyses
            \item support for re-analysing pieces of code
        \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Aliasing and Constant Propagation Analysis}
    
    \section{Tables}
        Dependencies handling. 
    
    \section{Type Analysis}        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Type Information representation
            \item Data Flow representation
            \item AST annotations
        \end{itemize}
