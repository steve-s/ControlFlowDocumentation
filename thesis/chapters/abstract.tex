Dynamic programming languages allow us to write code without type 
information and types of variables can change during execution. 
Although easier to use and suitable for fast prototyping, 
dynamic typing can lead to error prone code and is challenging 
for the compilers or interpreters.
Programmers often use documentation comments to provide 
the type information, but the \mbox{correspondence} of the 
documentation and the actual code is usually not checked 
by the tools. In this \wthesis, we focus on one of the most popular dynamic 
programming languages: PHP. We have developed a framework 
for static analysis of PHP code as a part of the Phalanger project -- 
the PHP to .NET compiler. The framework supports any kind of analysis, 
but in particular, we implemented type inference analysis with emphasis 
on discovery of possible type related errors and mismatches between 
documentation and the actual code. The implementation was evaluated 
on real PHP applications and discovered several real errors and 
documentation mismatches with a good ratio of false positives.
